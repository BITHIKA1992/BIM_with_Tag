# BIM_with_Tag
Budgeted Influence Maximization with Tag in a social network exploiting community structures.

Given a social network represented as a graph (directed or undirected), where each user is associated with a selection cost, the problem of Budgeted Influence Maximization (BIM Problem in short) asks for selecting a subset of the users (known as seed users) within
an allocated budget such that initial activation of these users leads to the maximum number of influenced nodes. 
Here, we have used Maximum Influence Arborance (MIA) diffusion model.
